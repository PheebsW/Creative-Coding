Growth mindsets vs Stagnant mindsets

	I firmly believe that a growth mindset will always be more beneficial to any given person’s wellbeing than a stagnant mindset. The human condition in and of itself is one based on change. Nothing stays the same. We are always growing, whether that be physically or socially. Choosing to remain in the same mindsets, the same opinions, the same limitations, is severely limiting. It prevents us from trying new things, from forming new ideas, and traps us in whatever state we were in when said mindset was initially formed. 
	A growth mindset, a true commitment to remaining open and willing to change our minds will do nothing but benefit us in the long run. Even if said opinion was correct (ex. I will never be good at coding), there is simply no point in not trying. You will have learned something new by the time that conclusion is reached, something you may take with you through your life. I’ve always been committed to a growth mindset and am willing to try no matter what.
