I was truly surprised by this lecture, not expecting to be hit so hard by his different messages. His speaking style and general charisma is touching and truly genuine.The touches of humor despite his unfortunate condition is truly inspiring. His general disposition really plays towards a lot of these aforementioned messages he’s trying to get across, such as perseverance, taking criticism with as much optimism as possible, and looking for the best in everyone. Everything he’s done, the things he’s accomplished, has been thanks to these lessons he’s actively applied to his own life. That’s part of what makes this message hit as well, the examples he has of him applying these lessons and the results of such. 
Particularly the message regarding patience with those around you. I resonate with this because I’ve personally had points in my life where I haven’t shown people my best. With some time and some hard work though, I’ve put my best self forward. I’m in college now! Even the worst of people aren’t “bad people”, they just see no reason to show you their best at that time. Giving people the space and time shows trust and is a wonderful motivation to come out of their hardened shells. Another point he has that plays well with this is his persistence. The difficulty of keeping motivation is often massively outweighed by the rewards. Even if that persistence is placed in something that isn’t directly related to your goal, it often leads to accomplishing that goal anyway. His taking a roundabout way to achieving his dream of becoming a Disney Imagineer was truly inspiring.
All in all, this lecture was something I believe most people need to watch. Whether it be the lessons about headfakes, persistence, or even that acid trip of a VR demonstration, it’s so much fun and extremely touching.
