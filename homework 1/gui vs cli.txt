	Graphic User Interfaces and Command Line Interfaces have a lot of unique differences and similarities, the primary of which is accessibility. Command Line Interfaces (CLIs) actually came first as they present closer to how a computer thinks, working in simple text with specific, predetermined commands. While CLIs are more effective at larger projects/changes, they also have a higher barrier to entry, needing more knowledge about what commands to use and how to use them in tandem to get the desired result, making them more difficult for the average person who just bought a computer to use effectively. That's where Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs) come into play. Invented after CLIs were already the established norm, GUIs work to make the processes of a computer simpler and easier to work with for newcomers to this genre of technology. GUIs use easier to understand graphical menus to get you to your desired goal. Rather than using commands you may not be familiar with to change the name of a file, instead you simply right-click the file and navigate the small menu that just opened up and click rename. While GUIs are, no doubt, easier to use, this ease of use also makes processes slower and more time consuming. It might be easier to just edit the file with those simple menus, that means you have to edit each individual file to achieve what you want, while a simple command can work en masse to achieve whatever you want in a smaller amount of time. In conclusion, it comes down to your skill level and the processes you're trying to do. If you just bought your first laptop, GUIs are going to be your best friend. Alternatively, if you're trying to build a large scale server, CLIs will be infinitely more helpful.
