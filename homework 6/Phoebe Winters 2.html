        "Dawned in a black cloak and pale skin, a wretched figure is seen in the early morn of the glassway. A myth to some, an icon to others, but for those whove met him.. he's nothing more than a walking corpse, cursed to roam the lands for his crimes against the gods. 

        Though his past remains shrouded in mystery, what is known is in his travels, he began collecting ingredients. Just berries and exotic flora at first, graduating to the heads of wolves and the hearts of rabbits, learning quickly the real magic lies in the depraved. Continuing his work led him to realize something. The open space on the market for a more.. extreme product.

        Seeing an opportunity to finally make something of his punishment, he sets up a shop in the Glassway, criminals and thieves naturally being drawn to his questionably legal items. Soon, he becomes a gateway to a seedy underbelly, a black market in the glassway. Everyone knows him. He knows everyone."
